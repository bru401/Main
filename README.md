# Portfolio
This repository is ***a curated collection of my main data-related projects***, developed with the goal of demonstrating **technical proficiency** in the relevant tools and programming languages, alongside the skills involved in handling **complete data-driven projects** that are successful in uncovering and presenting insights on the data, from the initial scope setting to final presentation.

Each of these projects reflect *my approach* to working with data: starting from a concrete question or business problem, selecting appropriate tools, structuring the analysis clearly, and communicating results in a way that supports real-world decision-making. 

In order to showcase the extent of my understanding of the data lifecycle, this portfolio spans Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Data Engineering. 
I have organized the projects below in such a way as to make it easier to understand **what problems** were tackled, **which technologies** were used, and what kind of **value** each project aims to deliver.

# Data Analytics
### Python (Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotlib, Seaborn)
* 'Pandas in Practice - Netflix'(./Data_Analytics/pandas-in-practice-netflix.ipynb) -> A hands-on project demonstrating my understanding of *the core data analysis workflow* using Python and Pandas. The project covers *data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and visualization*, and extracts real life insights from a real dataset.
* 'Abandono Escolar - Data Analysis' -> (PT-BR) Um projeto em Python que busca responder questões de uma de minhas áreas de maior interesse: políticas públicas.

# Business Inteligence
### PowerBI, SQL
* AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard -> An interactive *sales dashboard* built for a hypothetical company, using Microsoft Power BI and SQL. The project highlights my ability to model data, define meaningful KPIs, and design dashboards that support business monitoring and strategic insights.

# Data Engineering
### Databricks, Python, SQL
* Data Pipeline for Marketing Analytics – Databricks MVP -> A *minimum viable product* (MVP) designed to demonstrate my understanding of *ETL fundamentals* and *cloud-based data platforms*. The project focuses on data ingestion, transformation, and storage within a *Databricks environment*, simulating a real-world analytics pipeline used to support marketing analysis.

# Misc
* Monografia -> (PT-BR) A minha introdução à criação de projetos de análise de dados
